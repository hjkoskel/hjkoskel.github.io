# Fatpuppy project

Goal of this project is to create open source hardware and software platform for differential ion mobility spectrometry.

Now there exists single technology demonstrator spectrometer.


## Hardware modules

Basic outline of spectrometer
- Have air flow thru system made by pump
- Ionize air, let charge exhange happen
- Draw thru channel capacitor, filter by non symmetric high voltage rf waveform
  - Change waveform, pass selectivily different kind of ion clusters
- Detect all ions coming from


### FPGA hardware
 Whole thing is controlled by FPGA.

 TODO WHY FPGA
 - generate waveform
 - sync ADC with 

### FAIMS driver

### Ion cell + Ion current amplifier & bias


### Ionization
